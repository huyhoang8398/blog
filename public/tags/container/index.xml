      <description>Have you ever faced this scenario where you want to run two or more lightweight services or multiple executables within the same container when the image starts running?&#xA;Recently I worked on a PHP application that used cron for background processing.

Supervisor controls these processes, and ensures that the container fails as soon as any process fails.</description>
