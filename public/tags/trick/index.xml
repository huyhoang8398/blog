Also since I&amp;rsquo;m moving to vscode now with vim extension&amp;hellip; so I dont really need to use terminal all the time ( just dropdown terminal + tmux is enough ) Read this post hehe&#xA;Requirement iterm2 - I think everyone is using iterm2 on MacOS hehe Setup iterm2 as dropdown terminal Open iterm2 Go to iterm2 setting -&amp;gt; keys -&amp;gt; Hotkey -&amp;gt; assign the global hotkey you want ( mine is control + ` ) Setting iterm2&amp;rsquo;s apperance as dropdown terminal Go back to iterm2 setting -&amp;gt; profile -&amp;gt; Window -&amp;gt; Style -&amp;gt; Full-width Top of Screen Exclude iterm2 from task switcher Restart iterm2 Try your hotkey Add iterm2 to login iterm ( starting at boot ) Extra: you can use combo tmux + dropdow :)</description>

      <description>Today my co-worker asked me how to revert to an old and good commit on master ( after you accidentally merged dev branch to master ). There are many ways to do that, for example we can use reset to discard all wrong commit to revert back, like undo when writing text. You can find others way onthis topic on Stack Overflow But the problem is too many options, we dont know which one is good, or even dont need to understand - it just works.</description>
